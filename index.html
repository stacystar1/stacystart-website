      Hi there, my name is Akshitha. I am a 4th grader and 5/28 was the last day
      of school. I cannot wait to be in fifth grade and be one of the top dogs of elementry school. My teacher was a girl and was so nice. I will miss her this summer but I hope to see her next year. My fveriot pet's are puppies. As you can see one is sliding across the page right this instant. My faveriot breed of dogs are the greman sheperds. Right now there are over 900 million dog breeds. That is 100 million less than 1 billion! My best and most faveriot subgect is math. I know algebra, geomitry, order of operations, symmetry, and much much more.My dad is Sharath Chand Bhaskara. He is a documentation wrighter, bug finder and fixer. He has his own website called novice hacks so pro tips from him. Here is his website https://www.novicehacks.info/. Isn't it cool of how many tips and tricks he gives us? He used to always get sick so he barely went to school.
