      Hi there, my name is Akshitha. I am a 4th grader and 5/28 was the last day
      of school. I can not wait to be in fifth grade and be one of the top dogs of elementry school. My teacher was a girl and was so nice. I will miss her this summer but I hope to see her next year. My fveriot pet's are puppies. As you can see one is sliding across the page right this instant. My faveriot breed of dogs are the greman sheperds. Right now there are over 900 million dog breeds. That is 100 million less than 1 billion! My best and most faveriot subgect is math. I know algebra, geomitry, order of operations, symmetry, and much much more.
